# Open Hardware Guide

Following up on the 2016 “Let’s Go jHUB” programme, the OPEN HARDWARE GUIDE or #OHG is an outcome of the Open Tech and Repair Skills workshop led by Timm Wille and hosted by the Hive Colab innovation hub in Kampala.

As a follow-up to the first Open Learning Guide (#OLG) the Open Hardware Guide gives examples of hands-on skills possibilities and projects applying open hardware methodologies. Acting as an introduction to resources and as a tangible tool in the form of a rugged A1 poster for trainers, tinkerers and facilitators, the #OHG is ready for distribution to anyone interested in exploring open technologies in a very practical way.

The #OHG content was developed by the workshop participants based on their designs and documented steps in test workshops held with students at the Panyadoli Self-Help Secondary School in Bweyale, Uganda. Alongside the #OHG, the participants helped develop and test #ASKotek, the ‘Access to Skills and Knowledge – open tech emergency kit‘ a field-trainers resource tool-kit for repairing, building and learning about practical electronics including small scale solar power.

The Let’s Go jHUB (#LGJ) project, in collaboration with icebauhaus e.V. (Weimar), KAPITAL / jHUB (Juba) and r0g_agency for open culture gGmbH (Berlin), was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) through its programme of “Support for Media, Access to Information and Freedom of Expression”. Given the violence that broke out in Juba, South Sudan’s capital, in the summer of 2016, the programme was implemented though the generous support and cooperation of GIG partner organisations iceaddis in Addis Ababa, mLAB and iHUB in Nairobi, kLAB in Kigali and Hive Colab in Kampala.
